Great! Based on the structure of your course, we can strategically place the three code challenges to ensure they cover different aspects of the material progressively. Here are the ideas for the three code challenges:

### Code Challenge 1: Fundamentals and Data Structures (After Module 02)
**Objective**: Test students on basic R programming, data structures, and initial data handling techniques.
**Modules Covered**: 01-R-Fundamentals.Rmd, 02-DataStructureHandling.Rmd

#### Tasks:
1. **Basic R Programming**:
   - Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number using both iterative and recursive methods.
   - Demonstrate the use of control structures (if-else, for loop) to manipulate a vector of numbers.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - Create and manipulate vectors, matrices, lists, and data frames.
   - Convert a list into a data frame and perform basic data operations (e.g., selecting columns, filtering rows).

3. **Basic Data Handling**:
   - Load and explore a dataset from R's built-in datasets (e.g., `iris`).
   - Summarize the data (mean, median, mode) and visualize basic distributions using histograms and box plots.

### Code Challenge 2: Descriptive Statistics and Probability (After Module 06)
**Objective**: Assess students' understanding of descriptive statistics, probability distributions, and statistical concepts.
**Modules Covered**: 03-DataVisualization.Rmd, 04-DataAnalysisTypes.Rmd, 05-DescriptiveStatistics.Rmd, 06-ProbabilityAndStatistics.Rmd

#### Tasks:
1. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Calculate measures of central tendency and dispersion (mean, median, variance, standard deviation) for a dataset.
   - Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to describe the data.

2. **Probability Distributions**:
   - Fit and visualize different probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson) to a dataset.
   - Perform simulations to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem.

3. **Statistical Concepts**:
   - Conduct hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square tests) on the dataset.
   - Interpret the results and discuss the implications of Type I and Type II errors.

### Code Challenge 3: Inferential Statistics, Regression, and ANOVA (After Module 10)
**Objective**: Evaluate students' proficiency in inferential statistics, regression analysis, ANOVA, and logistic regression.
**Modules Covered**: 07-InferentialAndHypothesis.Rmd, 08-ANOVA.Rmd, 09-RegressionAnalysis.Rmd, 10-CategoricalDataAnalysis.Rmd

#### Tasks:
1. **Inferential Statistics**:
   - Perform hypothesis tests and interpret the results (t-tests, z-tests, chi-square tests).
   - Calculate and interpret confidence intervals.

2. **Regression Analysis**:
   - Fit both simple and multiple linear regression models to a dataset.
   - Interpret the regression coefficients and evaluate the model fit using R-squared and residual analysis.

3. **ANOVA**:
   - Conduct a one-way ANOVA to compare means across different groups.
   - Perform post hoc tests to determine which groups differ significantly.

4. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Fit a logistic regression model to a binary outcome dataset.
   - Interpret the coefficients and evaluate the model using ROC curves and AUC.

### Placement in the Course:
- **Code Challenge 1**: After 02-DataStructureHandling.Rmd
- **Code Challenge 2**: After 06-ProbabilityAndStatistics.Rmd
- **Code Challenge 3**: After 10-CategoricalDataAnalysis.Rmd

These challenges will ensure that students are tested on key concepts and techniques progressively, aligning with the course content they have learned up to that point.












Yes, this is certainly doable! Here's a detailed plan to create and implement the code challenge based on your specifications.

### 1. Code Challenge Outline
The code challenge will cover the key concepts and techniques taught in the course, including hypothesis testing, regression analysis, ANOVA, logistic regression, and advanced data manipulation.

### 2. Challenge Structure
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Conduct a t-test and interpret the results.
- **Regression Analysis**: Perform both simple and multiple linear regression, interpret the coefficients, and evaluate the model.
- **ANOVA**: Conduct a one-way ANOVA, interpret the results, and perform post hoc tests.
- **Logistic Regression**: Fit a logistic regression model, interpret the coefficients, and assess the model fit.
- **Data Manipulation**: Use `tidyverse` functions to manipulate and summarize data.

### 3. Template for the Code Challenge
The template will include placeholders for each task with instructions. Students will fill in their code in the specified sections.

### 4. Auto-Grader Setup
The auto-grader will run predefined tests on the student's submitted code to evaluate correctness and completeness. We'll use a combination of R's testing frameworks like `testthat` and custom scripts.

### 5. Submission and Evaluation
Students will submit their code via GitHub Pages. The auto-grader will provide immediate feedback and scores. Once satisfied, students can finalize and upload their code, which will be sent to the teacher's Google Drive.

### 6. Recording Marks
The marks for each challenge and overall course performance will be recorded. This can be managed through a database or a simple spreadsheet linked with the grading system.

### Detailed Implementation

data_anova <- data.frame(
  value = c(group1, group2, group3),
  group = factor(rep(c("Group1", "Group2", "Group3"), each = 20))
)

model_logit <- glm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data_logit, family = binomial)
summary(model_logit)
exp(coef(model_logit))

# SECTION 5: Data Manipulation

# Select and rename columns
selected_data <- data_mtcars %>%
  select(mpg, cyl, hp, wt) %>%
  rename(Miles_Per_Gallon = mpg, Cylinders = cyl, Horsepower = hp, Weight = wt)

# Filter rows
filtered_data <- selected_data %>%
  filter(Miles_Per_Gallon > 20, Cylinders == 4)

# Create new columns
mutated_data <- filtered_data %>%
  mutate(Horsepower_per_Weight = Horsepower / Weight,
         Weight_Category = ifelse(Weight > 3, "Heavy", "Light"))

# Summarize data
summary_data <- mutated_data %>%
  group_by(Weight_Category) %>%
  summarise(Mean_Horsepower_per_Weight = mean(Horsepower_per_Weight),
            Count = n())

print(summary_data)
```

#### Auto-Grader Setup

We'll use `testthat` to write tests that will automatically grade the student's submissions. Here's an example of how the tests can be structured:

```r
# AUTO-GRADER SCRIPT

library(testthat)

# Hypothesis Testing
test_that("t-test mean is correct", {
  expect_true(t_test_result$estimate == mean(data))
})

test_that("t-test p-value is correct", {
  expect_true(t_test_result$p.value < 0.05)
})

# Regression Analysis
test_that("simple regression coefficient is correct", {
  expect_true(coef(model_simple)[2] > 1.5 && coef(model_simple)[2] < 2.5)
})

test_that("multiple regression coefficients are correct", {
  expect_true(coef(model_multiple)[2] > 1.5 && coef(model_multiple)[2] < 2.5)
  expect_true(coef(model_multiple)[3] > 1.0 && coef(model_multiple)[3] < 2.0)
})

# ANOVA
test_that("ANOVA F-value is significant", {
  expect_true(summary(anova_result)[[1]][["Pr(>F)"]][1] < 0.05)
})

test_that("Tukey HSD results are correct", {
  expect_true(tukey_result$group1[1] < -1)
})

# Logistic Regression
test_that("logistic regression coefficients are correct", {
  expect_true(exp(coef(model_logit))[2] > 3)
  expect_true(exp(coef(model_logit))[3] < 1)
})

# Data Manipulation
test_that("data manipulation is correct", {
  expect_true(nrow(filtered_data) == 11)
  expect_true(summary_data$Mean_Horsepower_per_Weight[1] > 40)
})
```

#### Submission and Evaluation

1. **Submission**: Students will upload their R script to a GitHub repository set up for this purpose.
2. **Auto-Grader**: A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) will be configured to run the `testthat` script automatically upon submission.
3. **Feedback**: The results will be provided as feedback through the CI/CD pipeline, showing which tests passed or failed.
4. **Final Submission**: Once satisfied, students can finalize their submission, which will be automatically sent to the teacher's Google Drive and recorded.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create GitHub Repository**: Set up a repository for students to fork and submit their code.
2. **Set Up GitHub Actions**: Configure GitHub Actions to run the `testthat` script on every push to the repository.
3. **Google Drive Integration**: Use Google Drive API to automatically upload final submissions to a specific folder.

This setup ensures that students get immediate feedback on their code, and the teacher can efficiently manage and review submissions.
