# Data Visualization in R (Light Focus)

## Introduction to ggplot2 and Basic Plotting

Effective data visualization is key to interpreting data and communicating results clearly. In R, `ggplot2` is one of the most powerful tools for creating a wide variety of static, aesthetic, and informative plots. This section introduces `ggplot2`, its syntax, and basic plotting techniques.

### ggplot2 Syntax and Layering System

`ggplot2` is based on the grammar of graphics, a system that allows you to create graphs layer by layer. You start with data, add `aes` (aesthetics) to indicate which variables to plot, and then add `geoms` (geometric objects) to decide the type of plot.

```r
library(ggplot2)

# Basic syntax
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point()  # adds a layer for scatter plot
```

In this example, `mtcars` is the dataset, `wt` (car weight) and `mpg` (miles per gallon) are the variables, and `geom_point()` creates a scatter plot.

### Creating Histograms, Bar Plots, and Scatter Plots

Histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots are fundamental for exploring data distributions and relationships between variables.

#### Histograms

Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of a single continuous variable by dividing the data into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin.

```r
# Creating a histogram of car weights
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = "blue", color = "black")
```

#### Bar Plots

Bar plots are useful for comparing quantities corresponding to different groups.

```r
# Convert cyl (number of cylinders) to a factor for a bar plot
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)

# Creating a bar plot of car counts per cylinder type
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = cyl)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "tomato", color = "black")
```

#### Scatter Plots

Scatter plots are ideal for examining the relationship between two continuous variables.

```r
# Creating a scatter plot of mpg vs wt
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "dodgerblue")
```

### Aesthetics and Themes

`ggplot2` allows extensive customization of plots through aesthetics and themes, enabling you to make plots more informative and appealing.

```r
# Enhancing scatter plot with themes and labels
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = cyl)) +  # Color points by cylinder count
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  labs(title = "Car Weight vs. MPG",
       x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
       y = "Miles per Gallon",
       color = "Number of Cylinders") +
  theme_minimal()  # Using a minimal theme
```

These examples demonstrate basic `ggplot2` usage for creating various types of plots, setting the stage for more advanced visualization techniques. Each type of plot serves different purposes and can be tailored extensively using `ggplot2`'s powerful customization options.


## Code Exercises 1

**Exercise 1: Create a Histogram**
Task: Use the `ggplot2` package to create a histogram of the `hp` (horsepower) variable from the `mtcars` dataset. Customize the bin width to 20 and set the fill color to green.

```r
library(ggplot2)

# Task: Create a histogram of the hp variable from the mtcars dataset
# Customize the bin width and fill color
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, fill = "green") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Car Horsepower",
       x = "Horsepower",
       y = "Frequency")
```
```r
# TODO: Insert Exercise chunk with error messages and solutions.
```

**Exercise 2: Create a Bar Plot**
Task: Create a bar plot showing the number of cars with each number of gears (`gear`) in the `mtcars` dataset. Use the color red for the bars.

```r
# Task: Create a bar plot of the gear variable from the mtcars dataset
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(gear))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "red") +
  labs(title = "Number of Cars by Gear Count",
       x = "Number of Gears",
       y = "Count")
```
```r
# TODO: Insert Exercise chunk with error messages and solutions.
```

**Exercise 3: Create a Scatter Plot**
Task: Plot `mpg` (miles per gallon) against `disp` (displacement) using `ggplot2`. Color the points by `cyl` (number of cylinders), and add a smooth line to the plot.

```r
# Task: Create a scatter plot of mpg vs disp, color by cyl, and add a smooth line
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "MPG vs. Displacement",
       x = "Displacement",
       y = "Miles per Gallon",
       color = "Number of Cylinders")
```
```r
# TODO: Insert Exercise chunk with error messages and solutions.
```
**Exercise 4: Customize a Scatter Plot with Themes**
Task: Enhance the previous scatter plot by applying the `theme_bw()` theme and customizing the plot's text elements and legends.

```r
# Task: Enhance the scatter plot with theme_bw and customize text and legends
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "MPG vs. Displacement: Enhanced Visualization",
       x = "Displacement (cc)",
       y = "Miles per Gallon",
       color = "Cylinder Count") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "top"
  )
```
```r
# TODO: Insert Exercise chunk with error messages and solutions.
```

These exercises encourage students to apply their knowledge of ggplot2 for creating, customizing, and enhancing visual representations of data. By completing these tasks, students will gain hands-on experience in effectively communicating data insights through visualizations.


# Customizing Graphs for Data Presentation

Visualizing data effectively involves more than just creating basic plots; it requires customization to enhance clarity and impact. This section of the course will teach you how to customize axes, legends, and labels, fine-tune scales and coordinates, and add annotations and custom geometries using ggplot2 in R.

## Customizing Axes, Legends, and Labels

Customizing the textual components of your plots helps in making them more readable and informative. `ggplot2` allows for detailed adjustments to these elements.

### Customizing Axes

You can modify the text of axis labels and adjust the axis limits to focus on specific areas of the data.

```r
library(ggplot2)

# Example of customizing axes
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous("Weight (in 1000 lbs)", limits = c(1, 6)) +
  scale_y_continuous("Miles Per Gallon", limits = c(10, 35)) +
  labs(title = "Car Weight vs. Fuel Efficiency")
```

### Customizing Legends

Adjusting the legend involves changing its title, text, and position to improve the overall aesthetics and readability.

```r
# Example of customizing legends
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(color = "Number of Cylinders") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

### Customizing Labels

Labels for the entire plot, axes, and legends can be styled to enhance clarity or to align with publication standards or personal preferences.

```r
# Example of customizing labels
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Vehicle Dynamics",
    x = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)",
    y = "Fuel Efficiency (MPG)",
    color = "Cylinders"
  )
```

## Fine-tuning Scales and Coordinates

Manipulating scales and coordinates can help in presenting data more effectively by adjusting the visual representation to better fit the dataset's story.

### Scales

Scales adjust how data is mapped to aesthetics. You can set the scale for each aesthetic (like color, size, or shape) to control the visual properties of the plot.

```r
# Example of adjusting color scales
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = hp)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red")
```

### Coordinates

Using coordinate functions, you can adjust the plotting area, aspect ratios, or flip axes which is useful for certain types of data or specific visual effects.

```r
# Example of flipping coordinates
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_flip()
```

## Adding Annotations and Custom Geometries

Annotations and custom geometries enhance plots by adding text annotations, lines, or other shapes to highlight specific features or data points.

### Annotations

Adding text annotations to highlight specific points or areas on the plot.

```r
# Example of adding annotations
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  annotate("text", x = 5, y = 30, label = "Outlier", color = "red")
```

### Custom Geometries

You can draw shapes or lines to highlight trends or important areas.

```r
# Example of adding custom geometries
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 20, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray")
```

These customization techniques in ggplot2 enable you to tailor your visualizations precisely to your dataâ€™s narrative, improving not only the aesthetics but also the effectiveness of your data presentations.

## Code Exercises 2

**Exercise 1: Customize Axis Labels and Limits**
Task: Create a scatter plot of `disp` (displacement) vs `mpg` (miles per gallon) from the `mtcars` dataset. Customize the axis labels to be more descriptive and set appropriate limits for better data focus.

```r
library(ggplot2)

# Task: Customize axis labels and limits
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous("Engine Displacement (cc)", limits = c(100, 500)) +
  scale_y_continuous("Miles per Gallon", limits = c(10, 35)) +
  labs(title = "Engine Displacement vs. Fuel Efficiency")
```

**Exercise 2: Customize and Reposition the Legend**
Task: Plot `wt` (weight) against `mpg` with `cyl` (number of cylinders) as a color factor. Customize the legend title and reposition it to the top of the plot.

```r
# Task: Customize legend title and reposition
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(color = "Cylinder Count") +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  labs(title = "Car Weight vs. Fuel Efficiency by Cylinder Count")
```

**Exercise 3: Add Annotations to Highlight Specific Data Points**
Task: Highlight vehicles with mpg greater than 30 or disp less than 120. Add a custom text annotation near these points.

```r
# Task: Highlight specific data points with annotations
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(mpg > 30 | disp < 120, as.character(mpg), "")),
            hjust = -0.1, vjust = 0) +
  labs(title = "Highlighting Efficient Vehicles")
```

**Exercise 4: Add Custom Geometries to a Plot**
Task: Create a plot of `hp` (horsepower) against `mpg`. Add a horizontal dashed line at the median horsepower and a vertical solid line at the median mpg.

```r
# Task: Add custom lines to indicate median values
median_hp <- median(mtcars$hp)
median_mpg <- median(mtcars$mpg)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = median_hp, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = median_mpg, linetype = "solid", color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Horsepower vs. Fuel Efficiency with Median Lines")
```
