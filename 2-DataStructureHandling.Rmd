## Data Structures and Data Handling in R (Light Focus)

### Overview of Vectors, Matrices, Lists, and Data Frames

Understanding and effectively manipulating basic data structures in R is foundational for all subsequent data manipulation and analysis tasks. This section will guide you through creating and working with vectors, matrices, lists, and data frames.

#### Creating and Manipulating Vectors

Vectors are the simplest and most common data structure in R. They store an ordered collection of elements of the same type. Understanding vectors is crucial as they form the building blocks for more complex data structures.

```r
# Creating a numeric vector
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Demonstrating vector concatenation by adding an element
numbers <- c(numbers, 6)

# Accessing specific elements in a vector using their index
second_element <- numbers[2]  # Accesses the second element in the vector

# Creating a vector for temperature conversion
temperature_c <- c(23, 21, 24, 22, 20)
temperature_f <- temperature_c * 9 / 5 + 32  # Convert to Fahrenheit
print(temperature_f)
```

#### Operations with Matrices and Arrays

Matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute. They are useful for handling two-dimensional data. Arrays extend this concept to multiple dimensions.

```r
# Creating a matrix using the matrix function
matrix_data <- matrix(1:9, nrow=3, ncol=3)

# Accessing a specific element (row 1, column 2)
element <- matrix_data[1, 2]

# Transposing a matrix (switch rows and columns)
transposed <- t(matrix_data)

# Multiplying first row elements by 2 to demonstrate manipulation
matrix_data[1, ] <- matrix_data[1, ] * 2
print(matrix_data)
print(transposed)
```

#### Understanding Lists and Their Uses

Lists in R are a generic vector capable of holding elements of different types. This makes them extremely versatile for datasets that require a mix of numeric, character, and logical types.

```r
# Creating a list with mixed types
my_list <- list(name="John", scores=c(95, 82, 90), passed=TRUE)

# Accessing elements within a list using the $ operator
scores <- my_list$scores
print(scores)

# Adding a new element to the list to show its flexibility
my_list$address <- "123 Elm St"
print(my_list)
```

#### Data Frames for Tabular Data

Data frames are used extensively in R for storing tabular data. They resemble a table in a relational database or an Excel spreadsheet, with each column potentially holding a different type of data.

```r
# Creating a data frame
students <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Carol"),
  score = c(88, 93, 85),
  pass = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
)

# Accessing a specific column using the $ operator
names <- students$name

# Adding a new column to indicate if the student scored an A (score > 90)
students$grade <- ifelse(students$score > 90, "A", "B")
print(students)
```

### Code Exercises

**Exercise 1:** Create a numeric vector representing the temperatures of the days of the week and convert them to Fahrenheit. Print the results.

```r
days_temps_c <- c(16, 18, 15, 17, 16, 19, 18)
days_temps_f <- days_temps_c * 9 / 5 + 32
print(days_temps_f)
```
```r
# TODO: Insert Exercise chunk with error messages and solutions.
```
**Exercise 2:** Create a 3x3 matrix with numbers from 1 to 9, then multiply the second row by 2. Print the modified matrix.

```r
matrix_3x3 <- matrix(1:9, nrow=3)
matrix_3x3[2, ] <- matrix_3x3[2, ] * 2
print(matrix_3x3)
```
```r
# TODO: Insert Exercise chunk with error messages and solutions.
```
**Exercise 3:** Create a list containing a vector of your favorite fruits, your age, and whether you like biking. Print each element.

```r
personal_info <- list(fruits = c("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"), age = 30, likes_biking = TRUE)
print(personal_info$fruits)
print(personal_info$age)
print(personal_info$likes_biking)
```
```r
# TODO: Insert Exercise chunk with error messages and solutions.
```
**Exercise 4:** Create a data frame representing three students with fields for name, age, and favorite color. Then add a column to indicate if their favorite color is blue. Print the data frame.

```r
students_df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Carol"),
  age = c(20, 22, 19),
  favorite_color = c("blue", "red", "blue")
)

# Adding a column to indicate if their favorite color is blue
students_df$is_blue <- students_df$favorite_color == "blue"
print(students_df)
```
```r
# TODO: Insert Exercise chunk with error messages and solutions.
```

These exercises are designed to build your confidence in working with R’s fundamental data structures, allowing you to effectively manage and analyze data. This hands-on approach helps cement the concepts by applying them in practical scenarios.


## Data Handling Techniques with dplyr

The `dplyr` package in R is a powerful tool for data manipulation, providing a coherent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges. This section will cover how to use these verbs to select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, join, and group your data.

### Selecting, Filtering, and Arranging Data

`dplyr` makes it easy to select specific columns of data, filter rows based on conditions, and arrange data in ascending or descending order.

#### Selecting Data

Use `select()` to choose a subset of columns to keep.

```r
library(dplyr)

# Sample data frame
data <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David"),
  age = c(25, 30, 19, 22),
  salary = c(50000, 54000, 32000, 45000)
)

# Selecting only the name and age columns
selected_data <- select(data, name, age)
print(selected_data)
```

#### Filtering Data

`filter()` is used to retrieve rows that meet certain conditions.

```r
# Filtering to find only those over 25 years old
filtered_data <- filter(data, age > 25)
print(filtered_data)
```

#### Arranging Data

`arrange()` is used to reorder rows of a data frame.

```r
# Arranging data by age in ascending order
arranged_data <- arrange(data, age)
print(arranged_data)
```

### Mutating and Summarizing Data Sets

`mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables, and `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.

#### Mutating Data

```r
# Adding a new column that calculates yearly savings potential
mutated_data <- mutate(data, savings = salary * 0.1)
print(mutated_data)
```

#### Summarizing Data

```r
# Summarizing to find the average salary
summary_data <- summarise(data, average_salary = mean(salary))
print(summary_data)
```

### Joins and Data Merging Techniques

`dplyr` provides several functions to merge data frames together, such as `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `inner_join()`, and `full_join()`.

```r
# Additional data frame with department information
department_data <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "David"),
  department = c("Finance", "IT", "Marketing")
)

# Joining data on the name column
joined_data <- left_join(data, department_data, by = "name")
print(joined_data)
```

### Group Operations with `group_by` and `summarise`

Grouping data makes it possible to compute summaries over groups of data.

```r
# Grouping data by department and calculating average salary
grouped_data <- data %>%
  left_join(department_data, by = "name") %>%
  group_by(department) %>%
  summarise(average_salary = mean(salary, na.rm = TRUE))

print(grouped_data)
```

This demonstration of `dplyr`'s capabilities shows how straightforward it is to manipulate and analyze data sets in R. These functions are not only powerful but also help make your data manipulation tasks more readable and concise.

Certainly! Let’s craft some practical exercises for this section on data handling techniques using `dplyr`. These exercises will reinforce the skills students need to manipulate and analyze data effectively with R.

### Code Exercises for Data Handling Techniques with `dplyr`

**Exercise 1: Select and Filter Data**  
Create a data frame and use `dplyr` to select specific columns and filter rows based on conditions.

```r
# Define the data frame
exercise_data <- data.frame(
  id = 1:5,
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David", "Eve"),
  age = c(28, 22, 35, 19, 31),
  salary = c(62000, 52000, 58000, 48000, 59000)
)

# Use dplyr to select the name and age columns, then filter for ages greater than 25
selected_filtered_data <- exercise_data %>%
  select(name, age) %>%
  filter(age > 25)

# Print the result
print(selected_filtered_data)
```
```r
# TODO: Insert Exercise chunk with error messages and solutions.
```
**Exercise 2: Arrange and Mutate Data**  
Add a new column to the data frame that calculates the monthly salary, then arrange the data frame by this new column in descending order.

```r
# Use dplyr to add a new column for monthly salary and then arrange by it
mutated_arranged_data <- exercise_data %>%
  mutate(monthly_salary = salary / 12) %>%
  arrange(desc(monthly_salary))

# Print the result
print(mutated_arranged_data)
```
```r
# TODO: Insert Exercise chunk with error messages and solutions.
```

**Exercise 3: Summarize Data**  
Calculate the average age and median salary from the data frame.

```r
# Use dplyr to summarize the data with average age and median salary
summarized_data <- exercise_data %>%
  summarise(average_age = mean(age), median_salary = median(salary))

# Print the result
print(summarized_data)
```
```r
# TODO: Insert Exercise chunk with error messages and solutions.
```

**Exercise 4: Join Data**  
Merge two data frames on the `name` column and explore the resulting joined data.

```r
# Additional data frame with department info
department_info <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Carol", "Eve"),
  department = c("Human Resources", "Marketing", "Product Development")
)

# Use dplyr to join the data frames
joined_data <- left_join(exercise_data, department_info, by = "name")

# Print the result
print(joined_data)
```
```r
# TODO: Insert Exercise chunk with error messages and solutions.
```
**Exercise 5: Group and Summarize Data**  
Group the data by a specified column (e.g., department) and calculate the total salary for each group.

```r
# Assuming the joined_data from Exercise 4
# Group by department and calculate total salary
grouped_summarized_data <- joined_data %>%
  group_by(department) %>%
  summarise(total_salary = sum(salary, na.rm = TRUE))

# Print the result
print(grouped_summarized_data)
```
```r
# TODO: Insert Exercise chunk with error messages and solutions.
```
